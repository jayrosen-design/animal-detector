## **Problem Statement**
Wildlife-vehicle collisions are a major issue, resulting in:
- Over 4,000 collisions every day in the United States.
- Millions of animal deaths annually, costing $8.4 billion in damages.
- 65% of surveyed drivers report witnessing or experiencing animal collisions.

WildSight offers an innovative, AI-powered solution to mitigate these risks and protect both wildlife and drivers.

For this prototype, image datasets of animals from Kaggle were used to classify 8 groups of animals commonly found near the road. These images were uploaded to Teachable Machine to train an AI model to identify animals. The TensorFlow trained model was integrated into a GPT-Engineer built react app, allowing a user to upload or take photos with a device for the AI to recognize, and emit an ultrasonic sound. A log records the animals detected and the ultrasonic audio that was emitted.
